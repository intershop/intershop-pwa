access to documents and records, and
enable inspections of the hardware and
software environment.
To this end, the User shall generate an “audit
log file” at the request of Intershop and send

of a number of parameters, such as the
number of Cores on which the Software is
run, and does not contain personal data. If
the User does not fulfill his obligation to send
back the audit log file, Intershop reserves the
right to conduct an on-site license audit after
prior and appropriate notice during normal

Transactions in accordance with this EULA on-

all necessary information.

all data relevant to invoicing and to store such
backups and unmodified data until the
successive invoice has been drawn up and the
relative accounting report has been
successfully transmitted. The User has to
define one contact person who will be
responsible for transmitting the reports.
The data creating the specific basis for drawing
up an accounting report must be stored in
unmodified form for a period of time of up to 6
months after the accounting report has been
successfully transmitted to Intershop, namely in
such a manner that an accounting report may
be created at any time from that data. In the

contentious accounting report shall be made
available without delay to Intershop upon
request.

Software, Intershop reserves the right to

use software granted by Intershop, are clear to
the third party.

continuous obligation (e.g. rental) shall not be

licence fees paid by the date of the breach, however
no less than Euro 25,000, in every individual case of
a breach, and the User is free to provide evidence of
any lower or higher damage.


§ 12 Conflict

If the User also uses General Standard Terms and
Conditions and the contents of these are congruent
with the EULA, said General Standard Terms and
Conditions should be regarded as having been
agreed. Contradictory individual provisions shall be
replaced by the provisions of modifiable law. The
same shall apply if the User's General Standard
Terms and Conditions contain provisions that are not
contained in the present EULA. If the present EULA
contains provisions not contained in the User's
General Standard Terms and Conditions, the
present provisions of the EULA shall apply.


§ 13 Final provisions

13.1 The parties agree that their relationship and
this Agreement shall be governed by German
Federal Law regarding all legal relations
entailed by this contractual relationship. UN law
on sales shall not apply.

13.3 All agreements representing a modification,
supplement or concretization of this EULA, and

13.4 If a provision in the present EULA is ineffective,
the effectiveness of the other provisions shall
not be affected thereby. If the present EULA
contains a loophole, this is to be filled by an
arrangement which most approximates what
the parties would have intended had they
considered this point.
