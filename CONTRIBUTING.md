## Contribution process

7. Add as much information as needed
8. Reference the solved issue
9. Wait for the review
10. PR is approved, denied (with explanation) or sent back for further information
11. We are trying our hardest for the fastest possible reviews of pull-request, issues, feedback and any other community interaction. However, we canâ€™t guaranty a particular timeframe for every answer. We hope you understand and excuse that.

## Commit Message Guidelines

In general we comply to the rules and formats of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).

We added the commit message linter [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) to the project to check wheather commit messages are correctly formatted.

With [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) there is also a wizard available to help you fill out all required information when committing.

Install with `npm install commitizen -g`. Afterwards you can use it by calling `git cz` when you want to commit something.

There also is a [VSCode extension for commitizen](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KnisterPeter.vscode-commitizen) available.
