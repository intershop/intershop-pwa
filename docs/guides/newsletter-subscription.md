# E-Mail Marketing/Newsletter Subscription

## Introduction

In the PWA registered users can subscribe to and unsubscribe from a newsletter service.

## Configuration

To enable this feature, an e-mail marketing provider has to be configured in Intershop Commerce Management under **Channel Preferences** | **E-mail Marketing**.
The PWA receives information about the e-mail provider configuration via the `/configurations` REST call under `marketing.newsletterSubscriptionEnabled`.

## Storefront

If the newsletter subscription feature is enabled, an additional checkbox is displayed on the registration page and on the account profile page that enables the user to subscribe to or unsubscribe from the newsletter service.
