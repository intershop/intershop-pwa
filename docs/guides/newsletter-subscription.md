# E-Mail Marketing/Newsletter Subscription

## Introduction

In the PWA registered users can subscribe/unsubscribe to a newsletter service.

## Configuration

To enable this feature an e-mail marketing provider has to be configured in the ICM under Channel Preferences / E-mail Marketing.
The PWA gets the information whether an e-mail provider is configured or not via the `/configurations` REST call under `marketing.newsletterSubscriptionEnabled`.

## Storefront

If the newsletter subscription feature is enabled an additional checkbox is shown on the registration page and the account profile page that enables the user to subscribe or unsubscribe from the newsletter service.
