# Migrations

## 0.18 to 0.19

We migrated from using [ngrx-router](https://github.com/amcdnl/ngrx-router) to the official and better supported [@ngrx/router-store](https://ngrx.io/guide/router-store).
This means that throughout the code all usage of the `ofRoute` operator and `RouteNavigation` actions are no longer available.

As some of these implementations were very specific, we cannot provide a migration script.

## 0.16 to 0.17

In this version change, we decided to no longer recommend the container-component-pattern and therefore changed the folder structure of the project.

We did this because the previously introduced facades provide a more convenient way to interact with the state management and more and more logic was moved out of containers, hence removing all ngrx-related imports there.

You can run the migration by executing `node schematics/migration/0.16-to-0.17`.

The script will check if all your components can be moved to the new folder structure and will then perform the migration or notify you of work previously needed.
