The goal of accessibility is to unlock the full potential of the Web and enable people with disabilities to participate equally.
The `@angular-eslint` repo contains a number of linting rules that can help enforce accessibility best practices in Angular component templates.

Most of the accessibility rules that are enabled in the Intershop PWA are contained in the plugin `@angular-eslint/template/accessibility` that is configured in the `.eslintrc.json` file of the project.
To check whether the rules are followed in your custom code or not, run `npm run lint`.

## General

### Attributes and Roles

Generally it is checked if valid `aria-*` and `role=*` attributes are used and that every necessary element is reachable with the keyboard, and that an action (like pressing enter) can be performed on them.

### Titles instead of ARIA-Attributes

If an element has to be made more descriptive by adding a title-attribute or an aria-label, we decided to use the title and not the label, because a title provides visual feedback and can also be read as a label by screen-readers.

:x: **Wrong HTML structure, title and aria-label would be read by a screen-reader**

```html
<button [title]="Close" [aria-label]="close">
  <span>x</span>
</button>
```

:warning: **Only use when no title is needed**

```html
<button [title]="Close" [aria-label]="close">
  <span>x</span>
</button>
```

:heavy_check_mark: **Preferred HTML structure**

```html
<button [title]="Close">
  <span>x</span>
</button>
```

### Usage of native HTML-Elements

It is generally advised to use native HTML-elements instead of giving roles to container-elements like a `<div>`, because native elements already bring most accessibility functionalities with them, like tab-focus and confirm by pressing enter.
If, for example, instead of a `<button>` a `<div role="button">` is used, the functionality of pressing enter to activate the button has to be manually implemented via code.

:warning: **Don't assign roles to HTML-elements that exist natively**

```html
<div role="button">
  <span>x</span>
</div>
```

:heavy_check_mark: **Use native HTML-elements if they exist**

```html
<button [title]="Close">
  <span>x</span>
</button>
```

## ESLint Rules

ESLint provides a plugin that includes most of the necessary accessibility-rules.
Only some individual rules that do not come with this plugin are specifically written down here.

### Accessibility Plugin

```
plugin:@angular-eslint/template/accessibility
```

For reference on which rules the plugin currently includes, please check the official repository:

- [ESLint-Plugin Accessibility Rules](https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint/blob/main/packages/eslint-plugin-template/src/configs/accessibility.json)

### Additional Rules

```
@angular-eslint/template/no-positive-tabindex
```

If an unreachable element has to be made reachable by providing a `tabindex`, the index should never be a positive number, only `0` (element is tab focusable) or `-1` (element is not tab focusable).
The tab-order has to be determined by the HTML-structure, not by the index.

## Project specific Applications

### How to fix `click-events-have-key-events` problems

To address this issue, make sure that every `<a>` tag in the HTML files includes a `routerLink` attribute.
If a link is only intended to trigger an action and not used to navigate the user to another page, it is recommended to use `<button>` tags instead of anchor tags, because buttons inherently provide better support for keyboard interactions and enhance overall accessibility.
To make the buttons look like links use the css classes `btn btn-link btn-link-action` for text links and `btn-tool btn-link` for icon links.
In case you have to use anchor tags nevertheless e.g. because of styling issues make sure you define a keypress.enter action and the tabindex="0" attribute for the anchor tag.

Other HTML elements (`<div>`, `<span>`, etc.) with a `click()` event that report this ESLint error can be fixed by adding a `(keydown.enter)` event that should be assigned with the `click()` event's method.
In addition, a `tabindex="0"` needs to be added to such elements to make them tab focusable.

### Form Submission using the key "Enter"

Implicit form submission using the "Enter" key is vital to assistive technologies, see also [HTML5 specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#implicit-submission).
Therefore, the `form` tag has to include an `input` of `type="submit"`, for example

```html
<form>
  <label for="foo">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" name="foo" id="foo" />
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

or a button of type "submit"

```html
<form>
  <label for="foo">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" name="foo" id="foo" />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

### Form submission in dialogs

Dialogs (or modals) are separated into three sections:

- modal header
- modal body
- modal footer

where the form is positioned inside the model body and the buttons are positioned inside the modal footer.
The following simplified example shows the wrong HTML structure:

:warning: **Wrong HTML structure**

```html
<div class="modal-body">
  <form (ngSubmit)="submit()">
    <formly-form></formly-form>
  </form>
</div>
<div class="modal-footer">
  <button type="button" (click)="submit()">Submit</button>
  <button type="button" (click)="cancel()">Cancel</button>
</div>
```

The button with the text "Submit" calls the same function `foo()` as the form `(ngSubmit)` but the form would not be submitted using the "Enter" key because the submit button is positioned outside the `form` tag.
The following example shows the correct HTML structure:

:heavy_check_mark: **Correct HTML structure**

```html
<form (ngSubmit)="submit()">
  <div class="modal-body">
    <formly-form></formly-form>
  </div>
  <div class="modal-footer">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    <button type="button" (click)="cancel()">Cancel</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

where

- the `form` tag surrounds both the formly form (including the form elements) and the submit button
- the function `submit()` is only called at the `form` tag
- the "Submit" button is correctly defined using `type="submit"` and does not call `submit()` using `(click)=""`
- the "Cancel" button is only defined as `type="button"` to prevent any default behavior
