# Styling & Behavior

The visual design (styling) and the interaction design (behavior) of the Intershop Progressive Web App is derived from the Responsive Starter Store with some changes (e.g., the header) to improve and modernize the customer experience and to provide an easy optical distinction between the two Intershop storefronts. While the Responsive Starter Store is based on a customized/themed [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/), the Intershop Progressive Web App styling was migrated to build upon the current version of [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/). This also means that the Intershop Progressive Web App styling is now based on [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).

## Bootstrap Integration

The styling integration is configured in the _\\src\\styles.scss_ of the project where Bootstrap together with the customizations is configured.

Instead of the Bootstrap 3 Glyphicons the current styling uses free solid icons of [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

The styling itself is integrated into the project as global style via the _styles.scss_ that is referenced in the _angular.json_ and is compiled automatically. Throughout the whole Intershop Progressive Web App, there are almost no component specific `styleUrls` or `styles` properties.

The [Javascript part of Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/) for the behavior is not directly used from the Bootstrap dependency since this implementation is jQuery based and not really suited to work in an Angular environment. For Bootstrap 4, [ng-bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io) provides _Bootstrap widgets the angular way_. Using these components works best with the styling taken from the Responsive Starter Store. However, the generation and structure of the HTML for the Angular Bootstrap differs from the HTML working with the original jQuery based _bootstrap.js_. Adaptions and changes in this area are inevitable.

## Assets

The assets folder is the place for any static resources like fonts, images, colors, etc., that are used by the storefront styling.

Currently the default font families for the Intershop Progressive Web App [Roboto](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto) and [Roboto Condensed](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Condensed) are placed here as copies from the Responsive Starter Store. They are not defined as npm dependency since the rendering results and the referenced file sizes of the npm packaged Roboto fonts were not the same as with the font files from the Responsive Starter Store.
