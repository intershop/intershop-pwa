# Migrations

## 0.16 to 0.17

In this version change, we decided to no longer recommend the container-component-pattern and therefore changed the folder structure of the project.

We did this because the previously introduced facades provide a more convenient way to interact with the state management and more and more logic was moved out of containers, hence removing all ngrx-related imports there.

You can run the migration by executing `node schematics/migration/0.16-to-0.17`.

The script will check if all your components can be moved to the new folder structure and will then perform the migration or notify you of work previously needed.
